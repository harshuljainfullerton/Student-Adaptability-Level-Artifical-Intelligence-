# Student-Adaptability-Level-Artifical-Intelligence

### Made Aritificial Intelligence with *Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier*
Partook a 4-week programming internship with California State University Fullerton. Worked with Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Matlab

Project Description:

This Python project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a dataset related to students' adaptability levels in online education. The project utilizes various libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to read, process, and visualize the dataset.

The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and reading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. The dataset contains information about students' adaptability levels, gender, age, and other factors. Descriptive statistics and data information are also displayed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

Next, the project visualizes different columns in the dataset using various plots and charts. Pie charts are used to display the distribution of adaptability levels and gender among the students. Additionally, count plots are used to visualize the effects of different factors on students' adaptability levels.

The project then proceeds to analyze the dataset using machine learning algorithms. The dataset is preprocessed by transforming categorical variables into numeric form using ordinal encoding. Three machine learning algorithms, namely DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, and RandomForestClassifier, are implemented and evaluated for their accuracy in predicting students' adaptability levels.

Confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the RandomForestClassifier algorithm. The matrix provides insights into the accuracy of the predictions and helps identify false positives and false negatives.

Finally, the project determines the most important factors in predicting students' adaptability levels using feature importance. The RandomForestClassifier algorithm is utilized to calculate the importance of each feature, and the top five most important features are visualized in a horizontal bar chart.

Overall, this project showcases skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning using Python and various libraries. It demonstrates the ability to preprocess and analyze datasets, visualize data using different plots and charts, and apply machine learning algorithms for prediction and classification tasks.
